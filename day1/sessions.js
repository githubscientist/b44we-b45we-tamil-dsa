        - why dsa?
        - what do they expect in a coding interview?
        - how to prepare ourselves for the coding interviews?
        - what are the platforms/resources we can use?
        - interview problem: how to solve it?
            - different approaches?
            - time complexities?
    
    2. Time complexity
        - asymptotic notations
        - time complexity?
        - 8 examples - different time complexity analysis
        - built-in datastructures: 
            - arrays
            - strings
    
    3. Linked List 
        - types
            - singly linked list
            - doubly linked list
            - circularly linked list
        - array vs linked list
        - linked list implementation

    4. Stack
        - implementation
            - array
            - object implementation
        - stack based interview question : 1 or 2 questions
    
    5. Recursion
        - What is it?
        - how to implement it?
        - recursion tree?
